        Well it's been a week since I've made any changes to my website. I still
        don't know exactly what I want this website to be I guess.

        <h3 id="headline-1">Looking back on the past two weeks</h3>

            It's the end of my second week afteer quitting my job. I'm super
            happy I quit my job for many reasons but the biggest reason is that
            now I can see that if I hadn't quit I would it would have taken me
            that much longer to come to the realization that I've come to now;
            It's going to be really hard to get the job I want...
          </p>

            The past two years I've been completely obsessed with neuroscience
            and pushing myself to do a phd that I haven't really been keeping up
            with what's going on in the tech industry. To be honest, I was
            definitely taking it for granted that after a bachelors in phyisics
            and then a masters in neuroscience that I would be a desirable
            candidate for most technical positions.

            My plan this year was to pull up in madrid, live with my girlfriend,
            easily pull in a sweet (even if underpaid) junior data science or ml
            job, and take this year in industry to compare to academia. Well
            look at me now!

            I've started some projects. Some are cooler than others, but now
            that data science isn't the cake walk I thought it was going to be
            it at least opens up my options a little bit more. If I'm going to
            do a lot of work on personal projects, at least I'm going to do
            things that are interesting to me, or lead me to an interesting job.

            Man it's overwhelming. Are any of these things what I want to do? I
            think my takeaway after these two weeks is to be less "job-title"
            oriented and be more project oriented...

            Hopefully by my next post I will be talking about how I have a more
            specific focus, and a more specific plan. There's only so long you
            can keep up motivation on doing undirected research.
