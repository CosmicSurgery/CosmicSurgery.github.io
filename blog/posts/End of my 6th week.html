        It's been 6 weeks now and I've more or less finished my first round of
        projects. These couple months I've split my time between bigger projects
        that I can put on my resume, and smaller projects that were either just
        for fun, or to try something I've been wanting to try for a while. My
        project on the tax code scraper is mostly done, I had to give myself a
        hard deadline there because otherwise the project would go on
        indefinitely. the tictactoe projects isn't quite done but I oulsnt being
        myself to formalize it in the same way as the tax code lookup, although
        I would still like to do that... Tge FPGA project has been the slowest
        project, which isn't too surprising since there is a significant
        learning curve with nearly every aspect of it. writing a few blog posts
        should be a sufficient enough goal there.
      </p>

        For the next month I'm going to try and focus mainly on interview prep,
        networking and enjoying Madrid while I'm still here. Also, I've decided
        to try and avoid all thoughts of doing a PhD for now, because juggling
        the job and PhD search is a bit overwhelming and I'd like to just commit
        to finding a job in the US for now...
      </p>

        Also, I'm going to try and do more networking. I want to find some
        mentors who can help guide me to figure out 1. What I want to do and 2.
        How to do that thing.
      </p>

        Is it better to have industrial or academic mentors? Or should I laser
        in on people in the neumorphic space already? I feel like they would all
        tell me to start a phd asap and not wait around...
