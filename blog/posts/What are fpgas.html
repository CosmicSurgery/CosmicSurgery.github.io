        What are FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and what are they for?
        Not too many people know about FPGAs, even STEM people. My dad works
        with FPGAs but when he tried to explain them to me most of the stuff
        went over my head. I think most people aren't aware of what FPGAs are
        because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are niche.</li>
        <li>
          Most of the time you don't need to know what makes it different from
          any other hardware.
        </li>
        <li>It's kind of hard to explain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        "FPGAs are something between software and hardware." This is the
        simplest explanation of what FPGAs are and is the one that I understood
        the best. My understanding quickly evaporated if you were to ask me:
        What makes it different from software? or How do you make hardware
        programmable?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I've started to
        <a href="/projects/project list/FPGAs/index.html"
          >learn how to program FPGAs</a
        >
        I wanted to learn what they actually are, and what I'm actually doing
        when I make an LED turn on and off depending on if a I push a button or
        not.

            basically combine logical gates in order to create some operations.
            They offer a middle ground between speed/performance and
            flexibility. So software is really good at creating flexible
            applications. This is really useful if you want to make a website,
            or an application that can run on different browsers on different
            devices. Software is also cheap to deploy, and the barrier of entry
            to learning programming is low with modern programmign languages
            like python. The downside of programming is that it is not very fast
            computationally. So in some use-cases where you need something that
            is really precise and high performing, it might be very difficult or
            impossible to get the job done with software. In these cases it
            would be useful to have a hard-wired circuit that does exactly what
            you want, such as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits).
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course this comes with some costs, such as the cost the
            manufacturing, designing and testing costs. It's not as trivial to
            test the circuits like it would be in software, and you can't modify
            the circuit after it's been fabricated. FPGAs are a middle ground,
            because they program hardware. So they are most useful in
            applications where you need something to be very precise, but it's
            not going to be mass-produced to the level where you would want to
            design a bunch of ASICs and have them mass produced.

            De Morgan's theorem states that we can build all logic circuits just
            with the NOT, AND and OR gates. From these smaller circuits we can
            create bigger circuits that can perform arithmetic, make decisions
            and can store previous states. Using electrical current and by
            intellgiently designing circuits in this way we can create chip that
            performs a certain task very quickly and robustly. In the above
            figure you can also see the truth table for each logic gate.

            Among the things we can create using De Morgan's theorem are:
            multiplexers and LUTs (lookup tables). Multiplexers are modules with
            multiple inputs, select registers and a single possible output.
            Using the the select registers you can control which input lines to
            output.

          <p>
            Similarly, LUTs are just like multiplexers except the inputs are
            values in programmable memory. We can choose which values to set the
            LUT inputs to be, thus approximating a logic gate. The below example
            is a LUT that is mimicking the logic of an AND gate.<sup

          <p>
            These LUTs are paired with flip-flops to create ALMs (Adaptive Logic
            Modules). These structures are spaced out on a grid connected by
            routing wires that allowing programmers to design exactly which
            modules connect to each other. The flexibility comes at the cost of
            speed.

            The last important thing to know is that FPGAs need to be
            re-programmed every time they are cycled.<sup id="footnote-5"
