      <p>
        Last week I spent a part of the weekend trying to re-create the famous
        "boids" simulation of bird flocking behavior orignally by Craig
        Reynolds. Here's a link<sup id="footnote-1"
          ><a href="#footnote-reference-1">1</a></sup
        >
        to his website which has been around since 1986 by the looks of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a pretty easy project. I knew this beforehand because any
        tutorial that shows off their boids simulation also tells you how it
        works, and often gives you the code for it. For that reason I started
        off the project without looking at any aid except the Craig Reynolds
        website to understand the big idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic principle is that with three components you can simulate
        flocking behavior, namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Separation</b> : Boids will seperate from other boids within the
          radius of some small cricle r
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Alignment</b> : Boids will will align themselves to other boids in
          the radius of some cricle r'
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cohesion</b> : Boids will will slowly move to the center of mass of
          the flock of birds that they are a part of, represented by cricle r''
        </li>
      </ul>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, I had some difficulties with the xbox screen record
            feature that I wasn't aware of at the time; When I would hit record,
            and then ran the code to bring up the simulation, the record feature
            would continue to record the background before the window came up...
            So annoying...
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I started as always by talking to chatgpt. At first I wasn't
            sure exactly which format would be the most convenient to present
            the boids simulation. I had seen others build a dynamic app with
            live tunable parameters so that you can mess with the simulation
            in-action. That was very appealing to me, but it looked like the
            best way to do that would be to create a web-app, which most likely
            means using javascript. I would have considered it, if I wasn't
            hosting everything on a static webpage on github.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end I decided to use the pygame package from python. So I
            told chatgpt what I wanted to do, and I asked it to start out by
            drawing the shape of a single boid. All I really was expected was
            for it to draw a triangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            It worked out great! It imported and created pygame peripherals, and
            then drew boids to the pygame screen on a continuous loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            As often happens with chatgpt, it also inferred lot's of things that
            I hadn't specified:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>It defined an intrinsic speed for each boid</li>
            <li>It defined an intrinsic angle for each boid</li>
            <li>
              It defined boundary conditions, boids would pass through the
              boundary and come out the other side
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Since this was (probably) my first experience with building a
            physically dynamic simulation I didn't have a great intuition about
            how to define the default parameters. I liked the idea of having a
            speed component, and then at every iteration taking the sin and cos
            of that value to update the boids location on a cartesian cooridnate
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing I wanted to change were the boundary conditions for
            the boids. In order to make it more easy to visualize I asked
            chatgpt to make a white box 20 pixels from the edge of the screen.
            Once it generated that snippet I changed the values for it to look
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't want boids to pass straight through the boundary and
            reappear on the opposite corner, I wanted them to loop around on the
            screen (That seemed more flocky to me).
          </p>
          <p>
            My idea was to calculate the angular difference of a boids heading,
            and it's angle with respect to the screen. I knew that if those
            angles were the same, it would mean the boid is travelling directly
            away from the the center of the screen, and if they were opposite it
            would travel directly towards the center of the screen. I designed a
            boundary condition update such that the boid such that it's heading
            would change by a factor of it's angular difference with screen
            center.
          </p>

            <figcaption>My notes on the boundary conditions</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This ended up being the most time consuming part of the entire
            project and took most of the weekend. I tried taking into account:
            the direction of approach to the boundary, angle-dependent rotation
            speeds, and played with different angular acceleration speeds. All
            of this <b>after</b> realizing that the angle that pygame uses to
            draw the boids and the true center angle that I was using
            (intuitively the unit circl) did not match! Unfortunately, the video
            demonstrating this was one of the casualties of the messed up
            recordings, but luckily I have the video I took immediately after to
            show that it had been fixed.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Ultimately, having independent x and y velocities instead of a fixed
            speed with changing directional angles ended up being much easier to
            implement. This also helped me manage the boundary conditions by
            simply changing the direction of a particular velocity component.

            Currently I the boid class is just responsible for drawing the boids
            to the gui and for handling the boundary conditions. However, I
            think an improvement would be to have the boid class handle the
            seperation, alignment and cohesion functions as well for clarity and
            consistency. Although I think the argument could be made that all of
            that functionality could be abstracted as well, as long as it's all
            consistent.
