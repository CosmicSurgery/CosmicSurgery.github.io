        I remember when I first was made aware of chatgpt. It was in Novebmer in
        2021, and I had just started the second year of my masters in Tübingen.
        It actually came at a really convenient time, because the second year of
        my program was dedicated to doing lab rotations and writing reports. The
        way the <i>Neural Information Process</i> program worked was that the
        first year would be all classes, then the second year we would have:
      </p>
      <li>
        6 weeks to write an essay report on any topic in Neuroscience we wanted
        (I did mine on ADHD) with a presentation at the end. <- Chatgpt comes
        out here!
      </li>
      <li>
        10 weeks of a lab rotation in any neuroscince lab with a presentation at
        the end (Systems Consolidation)
      </li>
      <li>
        6 months to write our masters thesis on any Neuroscience topic (Temporal
        Coding)
      </li>
      <p>
        Well since it was my first serious paper in college (I hadn't had to
        write a thesis for my Physics bachelor), I had no idea what to do or how
        to organize myself. The project started off as a neurotransmitters
        project, and I read some really cool papers from computational models to
        the physiological underpinnings. Maybe in another post I'll go into
        detail about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, at the beginning of the 6th and final week, I was trying to
        figure out how I was going to write 10,000 words on my little ADHD
        project. In retrospect I made it way way harder than it needed to be. I
        just needed to pick something interesting and review topics about it...
        Well anyway, chatgpt came out and I had a shiny new tool to help me get
        that word count up!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, chatgpt didn't know my writing style, it also didn't know
        very much about neuroscience or adhd. In the end I think I barely used
        it... However, I used it a little bit more for my lab rotation and a lot
        more during my thesis! In my case it served mainly as an idea generator.
        Sometimes I would ask it to start an outline for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember in the middle of my masters thesis I wanted to present my
        (half-baked) work at a conference for junior researchers and I had
        chatgpt draft an entire overleaf template! I was trying to come up with
        ideas to solve a pattern detection problem and it was suggesting ways
        that I could solve it. Most of the ideas I had already come up with but
        it did suggest one that I hadn't heard of and ended up using!
      </p>
      <p>
        So chatgpt is definitely useful, in a recent
        <a href="/projects/project list/RL/tictactoe/02-22-2024.html">post</a> I
        used it to create a game of tic tac toe. It saved me countless of hours
        and demosntrated it's utility as a python snippet generator. Ironically
        though, none of my use cases have been to actually have chatgpt generate
        the content. That's something I want to try.

            It was alright, and definitely more readable than my notes. The
            thing is I wanted it to be in the format of a blog post. And
            although it was readable, my notes were far more descriptive. I
            tried to give it some feedback:

    Exploring the Journey of Creating a Tic Tac Toe Bot: A Dive into Reinforcement Learning
Unveiling the Desire
As I embarked on the quest to create a bot capable of mastering Tic Tac Toe through reinforcement learning, 
I found myself immersed in the allure of crafting a digital mind that could explore the intricacies of the 
game. My vision was clear: I yearned for a bot that would not just play mechanically but would evolve, 
learning from every move and strategy it encountered.

Navigating the Initial Terrain
At the genesis of this endeavor, I couldn't help but notice the symmetrical nature of the Tic Tac Toe board. 
It dawned on me that the initial moves boiled down to a mere trifecta: the side, the corner, and the middle. 
Yet, as the game unfolded, the state space expanded exponentially, presenting a tantalizing challenge.

Contemplating State and Action Spaces
Intrigued by the complexity that lay ahead, I delved into the realms of state and action spaces. 
How best to represent these realms in a way that would empower the bot to navigate the game intelligently? 
I toyed with the idea of a board reflecting expected rewards, pondering over the interplay between state 
updates and action choices.

Pondering the Algorithm
A brute-force algorithm initially seemed a plausible approach. Yet, as I mused over its intricacies, 
I found myself grappling with questions of efficiency and scalability. How could the bot efficiently 
sift through the myriad of possible states and actions? How could it select actions that promised the 
greatest reward, while still allowing room for exploration?

Refining the Strategy
As I delved deeper into the nuances of the game, I realized the importance of heuristic storage. 
Could a sum-based reward system for row and diagonal victories provide a more nuanced understanding 
of game dynamics? Or would it inadvertently limit the bot's ability to grasp complex formations? These 
were the questions that lingered in my mind as I sought to refine my approach.

Looking Toward the Future
Yet, as I pondered over the limitations of my current approach, I couldn't help but wonder about the 
possibilities that lay ahead. Could neural networks offer a solution to the dimensionality problem? 
Might they provide a pathway to unlocking the true potential of the bot, enabling it to navigate the 
complexities of the game with ease?

Embracing Uncertainty
As I ventured further into the realm of reinforcement learning, I found myself embracing the uncertainty 
that lay at its core. End-of-game scenarios loomed on the horizon, presenting a myriad of potential actions 
and outcomes. Yet, amidst the uncertainty, there was a sense of excitement—a thrill that came from charting 
unknown territories and unraveling the mysteries of the game.

Conclusion: A Journey Unfolds
And so, as I set forth on this journey of creation, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. 
With each twist and turn, each challenge and triumph, the bot would inch closer to its ultimate goal: 
mastery of Tic Tac Toe. And though the path ahead was fraught with uncertainty, I knew that with each 
step, the bot would grow stronger, wiser, and more adept at navigating the complexities of the game.

This rendition seeks to capture the essence of your thought process, infusing it with the excitement and 
uncertainty inherent in the journey of creating a Tic Tac Toe bot using reinforcement learning.

            Oh my god... That was not what I wanted at all. I wanted it to flow
            a little bit but I wasn't trying to write poetry. I had a new idea:
          </p>
          <p>
            User: that sounded way to poetic, and isn't really my language...
            I'll show you other blog posts of mine so you can get an idea of the
            language I use:
          </p>
          <p>1. ```<{blog_post_1}>```</p>
          <p>2. ```<{blog_post_1}>```</p>
          <p>
            The result wasn't much better... Next I asked it to write the blog
            as if it were an engineer. I thought that might do the trick. With
            more coaxing it eventually produces this:

            Building a Tic Tac Toe Bot: My Journey with Reinforcement Learning
Getting Started
I've dived into making a Tic Tac Toe bot using reinforcement learning, and it's a mix of excitement and 
tech stuff. The goal is simple: make a bot that can play smart and learn as it goes.

Initial Look
Breaking down the game shows some basic moves: side, corner, and middle. But as the game rolls on, things 
get complicated with lots of possible moves and actions.

Planning the Design
Figuring out how to represent the game's state and moves is tricky. Do I use a board that shows expected 
rewards? Or is there a simpler way to guide the bot's decisions?

Mapping Out the Algorithm
Sketching out a plan, I'm thinking about how to balance trying new stuff and sticking to what works. A 
brute-force approach sounds easy but might not be efficient.

Tweaking as I Go
As I dig deeper, I'm testing out different ways to store moves and rewards. Can I find a way to track 
wins without overcomplicating things?

Looking to the Future
Next up, I'm thinking about using neural networks to handle the game's complexity. They might be the 
key to making the bot even smarter.

Wrapping Up
In the end, it's all about problem-solving and making things work. With each step, I'm getting closer 
to building a Tic Tac Toe champ.

In this version, I've simplified the language and toned down the use of literary techniques, aiming 
for a straightforward and basic style reminiscent of an engineer's approach.

            It was better... But I didn't like the unnecessary titles, and it
            was a bit clunky. It was around this point that I gave up and
            decided to write my own blog the old fashioned-way.

            If this can be done, someone is definitely already doing it. Maybe
            I'll see if there are any medium or tds posts on the subject. I know
            I've seen a lot of tweets essentially saying you can train llm's to
            talk like you buy giving them your writing. Would be interesting to
            look more into that...
