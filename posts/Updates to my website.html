        I'm continuing to make changes to my website, and I'm finding that if
        I don't manage my time, I spend hours playing with small details on my website.
        Here are the updates.
      </p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
A game changer

        The biggest thing I've started doing is using vscode, which has been a <b>huge</b>
        QOL improvement for developing this site. Now, instead of having like five seperate
        notepads (yes I was using notepad) open, I just have vscode with my site breakdown
        and a chrome window open with the live view of the website. Beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
        Other changes I've made:
    </p>

<ul>
<li>Reformatted my site, by creating a new folder for each tab in the nav bar.</li>
<li>Defined the projects I'm currently working on.</li>
<li>Wrote about it in my blog?</li>
</ul>

    What's next?
    </h2>
    <div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<b>Projects: </b>I'm still thinking of the best way to put my projects on display...
    Maybe the best thing to do is make figures and add them as images to my site
