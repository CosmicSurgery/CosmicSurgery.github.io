      <p>
        This walkthrough was inspired by the numerous failed PS integration tutorials that I was unable to
        complete. After following a few PL tutorials (successfully) and getting the LED's on my 
        zynq-7000 developers board to blink or respond to switches enforced by digitial
        logic on the fpga, I tried to integrate the processor as well. As it turns out it's
        much easier said than done.  
      </p>
      <p>
        After realizing that my version of vivado (2019.2) no longer 
        supported the vivado sdk for programming the processor, I had to install the new sdk: Vitis.
        Just the installation of Vivado and Vitis took me about a week since I needed to clear nearly
        60 gb on my computer, and I couldn't figure out how to download a standalone version of vitis.
        I initially tried to go with vivado 2012.2 (it's a smaller sized program) but I got advice from an expert
        telling me not to do this.
      </p>

        The thing that makes this flow so difficult is learning how to: integrate the different applications, manage the different files
        understand the order of operations. All of this is before even understanding the details of your own project! 
        For this reason clear and detailed tutorials are crucial for beginners in this space.

        Thanks to Robert Swan<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, who created the youtube video demonstrating a simple hello world build. After banging my head against the 
        wall it was nice to see my resilience pay off!
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is primarily a reference for myself, to help me develop consistent flow for all future projects that are going
        to involve some level of software integration. Therefore I will be skipping steps that are obvious to me.

      <p>
        We start out by directly creating block design. I'm not sure why in this case we don't bother at all with the constraints
        file (i guess the fpga isn't really doing anything?). For fpga implementations that seems like it would be an important part.
        Of course we will be needing the Zynq processor, which we can add by either right clicking on block design window, 
        or by clicking the plus sign in the block design toolbar. Next we click <b>Run Block Automation</b> in the green banner.
        The default presets are okay in this tutorial. What this does is it automatically configures certain aspects of the IP for you.
        So if you have multiple blocks it will automatically interconnect those blocks (for known IP structures). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we click on <b>Validate Design (F8)</b> in the design block toolbar. Here Xilinx is just checking to make sure there
        aren't any glaring errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick google search and I found out that I needed to connect FCLK_CLK0 to M_AXI_GP0-ACLK... Don't ask me why. When trying
        validate the design I also got four warnings warning me that DDR interfaces may fail when entering negative DQS skew values. 
        The official zybo tutorials tell us these warnings may happen and to just ignore them. Off to a good start!

      <p>
        Next we needed to click on the design source and <b>Create an HDL wrapper</b>. According to Digilent
        <sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, "this process translates 
        the block design into a source file that can be read by the Vivado tools, and is used to build the actual design". Got it...
        Leos313 \
        explains further: "The WRAPPER is the file that connect the output/input port of your design to the physical pin 
        described in the constraint file." 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the video, Robert describes it a little bit more; Basically in order to do the next step (Synthesis), the synthesizer
        is going to expect HDL code (HLD?) at the top level of the design. He also mentions that by letting Vivado manage the 
        wrapper it will also "auto-update" the wrapper so that we don't need to every time we make a change to the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to generate output products too apparently. Can read more about that here
        <sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This stage is actually three steps: <b>Synthesis</b>, <b>Implementtaion</b>, and <b>Generate bitstream</b>
      </p>
      <ul><li><b>Synthesis</b> - Takes all the files in the project and create a flattened netlis that instantiates all of the IP
      that we've either instantiated in the block diagram or inferred in the HDL code.</li>
      <li><b>Implementation</b> - Takes all the primitives in the flattened netlist and maps them to the primitives associated with
      the specific device when we created the project. (place and route is also done?)</li>
      <li><b>Bitstream</b> - This is responsible for programming the part.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can actually do all three by clicking <b>Generate Bitstream</b>, Vivado will know that we haven't done the other two steps
        and it will automatically run all three. This usally takes a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing we need to do in Vivado is to go to File -> Export -> <b>Export Hardware</b>, make sure tick the "include bitstream"
        box. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once that's done, we're finally ready to Launch Vitis. Click, <b>Create new platform project</b> and make sure to choose the same location
        as your vivado project (I think this is what I was doing wrong). If the .xsa file was created correctly, and if nothing else went wrong
        we should see the defaults.
        <ul>
          <li>Operating System: Standalone</li>
          <li>Processor: ps7_cortexa9_0</li></ul>
      </p>  
      <p>
        I found that if I delete a project and create a new one with the same name, Vitis will not have forgotten it somehow. I was having
        issues with my .xsa file and it wasn't until I started a comletely new project with a new project name that I was able to move one to
        the next step.
      </p>

        <img src="/projects/project list/FPGAs/captures/13 Load xsa.PNG" title="Load xsa">
        <figcaption>Load xsa.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The .xsa file is the HDL wrapper we created earlier. Then we should right click on the green platform project we have
        in the explorer tab and click <b>Build Project</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up until now we have just been configuring the hardware so that we have something to run. Now we actually need to create the hello world
        project. Hover over File, New and then click <b>Application Project...</b>. No we're getting ready to create the actual firmware that 
        is going to run on the Xilinx device. We can choose from some templates, in this case we go with hello world. Make sure to right click the 
        application project at this point and build it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, since this is a new project everything should look very clean in the explorer. At this point it's important to have the zybo
        plugged in and turned on. we can right click the application project we just created and hover over <b>Debug As</b>, 
        and then click <b>1 Launch on Hardware (System Project Debug)</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        It may also be necessary to set up the the serial console that vitis comes with. Otherwise we can click <b>resume</b>.

      <p>It works! (Unless it doesn't in which case I'm sorry I don't know how to help).</p>
