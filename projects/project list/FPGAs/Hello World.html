        This walkthrough was inspired by the numerous failed tutorials that I was unable to
        complete. After successfully following a few tutorials and getting the LED's on my 
        zybo zynq-7000 developers board to blink or respond to switches enforced by digitial
        logic on the fpga, I tried to integrate the zynq processor as well. As it turns out it's
        much easier said than done.

        After realizing that my version of vivado (2019.2) no longer 
        supported the vivado sdk for programming the processor, I had to install the new sdk: Vitis.
        Just the installation of Vivado and Vitis took me about a week since I needed to clear nearly
        60 gb on my computer, and I couldn't figure out how to download a standalone version of vitis.
        I initially tried to go with vivado 2012.2 (it's a smaller sized program) but I got advice from an expert
        telling me not to do this.

        The thing that makes this flow so difficult is learning how to: integrate the different applications, manage the different files
        understand the order of operations. All of this is before even understanding the details of your own project! 
        For this reason clear and detailed tutorials are crucial for beginners in this space.

        Thanks to Robert Swan<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, who created the youtube video demonstrating a simple hello world build. After banging my head against the 
        wall it was nice to see my resilience pay off!
