        So at this point, the tic tac toe logic is all set-up, I have a working
        menu with tkinter that allows the user to play with another person on
        the same computer, to play against an ai in single player mode, and to
        simulate tictactoe games between two ai's without a gui.

        <p>
          In a previous prompt, and without explicitly asking, chatpgt gave me a
          little function to check for empty values on the board. The function
          would loop through the board and check for empty values, populating a
          list of (row, col) tuples. This could also have been easily
          accomplished by using <code>np.where()</code> but at the time I was
          still trying to avoid using numpy if possible.
        </p>

            <pre><code class="python">
class NaiveAI:
def __init__(self, player):
  self.name = 'NaiveAI'
  self.player = player

def get_move(self, board):
  # Generate a random move
  empty_cells = [(row, col) for row in range(3) for col in range(3) if board[row][col] == 0]
  if empty_cells:
      return random.choice(empty_cells)
  else:
      return None  # No valid moves available (board is full or already won)

        <h3 id="headline-1">What I want</h3>
        <div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
          <p>
            I want a bot that explores possible moves, and tries different
            strategies to improve their chances of winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing that occurs to me is that the board is symmetrical.
            Thus there really are only 3 starting moves: side, corner and
            middle. Once this move has been played however the state space opens
            up:
            <li>corner -> 4 possible unique actions</li>
            <li>side -> 5 possible unique actions</li>
            <li>middle -> 2 possible unique actions</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay: So what is the best way to represent the action space?
            Probably the best way is to have a board with each square
            represented by expected reward? The state space has the same
            dimensionality as the action space, so as the state space updates
            the action space would as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other thing that is important is that the path that the agent
            took to get to a certain state space is irrelevant (thus there is no
            temporal component), the only thing that matters is: given the
            current state, what action should be done?
          </p>
          <p>Hmmm... What about a brute force algorithm?</p>
          <p>
            Everytime the ai is prompted to make a move, it checks the current
            state-space against a dictionary of previous states that it has
            already seen.
            <li>
              if it's a brand new state -> it adds this state to the dictionary
              with the key being the original board.
            </li>
            <li>
              it also create a new list of tuples to store it's previous moves
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>How many possible tic tac toe states are there anyway?</p>

          <p>Clearly I need to use a heuristic...</p>
          <p>
            I guess one solution to reduce the size of the state space would be
            just to store the relevant square right? Instead of storing the
            whole board, I could store the row and the diagonals of squares in
            consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naively I am going to start by assuming that placing moves on a row
            vs. a column or diagonal have an equal effect on win probability all
            things the same (However, I concede this might not be true).
            Following this trategy, the expected reward of each action could be
            defined by the sum of the contributions of all rows and diagonals.
          </p>
          <p>
            So an agent just needs to learn <b>those</b> combinations. There are
            3^3 - 2^2 - 2 or 27 - 8 - 2 = 17 possible combinations. Now that's a
            lot more manageable!
