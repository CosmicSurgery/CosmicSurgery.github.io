        A tax company has clients in various states around the country. The US has unique tax laws
        for each state on top of federal taxes. These taxes can be imposed by the state or even by the 
        municipality. State and local tax (SALT) practices are responsible for being up-to-date and informed
        on the responsibilies in order for companies to stay compliant.

        Supposedly, the state of Texas presents a unique challenge (the details are still a bit fuzzy) for companies trying to
        keep track of their taxes. The responsibility of the company is to track the addresses of the customers that
        they sell to. They then contract this particular tax company, to figure out how much they owe in taxes. texas
        has a website that makes it very convenient to know the tax rate from the state, municipality (and any other
        ordinance) by simply entering the address of the consumer. You can enter the address fields, click the address 
        on a dynamic map or even enter the coordinates (latitude and longitude). This work becomes tedious however
        when you have a spradsheet on the order of the thousands of unqiue transactions, each one with a unique address.
